A list of NMs that need to be defined in the nms directory:

- ~~Alfard~~

- ~~Briareus~~
- ~~Carabosse~~
- ~~Chloris~~

- ~~Itzpapalotl~~
- ~~Kukulkan~~
- ~~Orthrus~~
- ~~Sedna~~
- ~~Sobek~~
- ~~Ulhuadshi~~

~~Add README to nms directory that explains the nested structure of data.~~

## Commands

Commands to be added via the _addon command_ event:

- l/list - Lists all NMs that can be tracked. Example: et l
- t/track - track a specific NM. Example: et t sobek

Expand the track command to allow the first three characters of an NM name, because fuck having to remember how to spell Itzpapalotl.
