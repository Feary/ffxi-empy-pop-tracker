# Todo list

* Investigate if an icon or ascii symbol can be used instead of "[KI]".
* Update readme image following update to (?-?). Also make it smaller.
* Perform a full test of monster pop items, and mob & pop locations.
* Add multi-bag support - search inventory plus sack, satchel, case and items in mog house.
  * Label an item in a different bag. Example: Orbn. Cheekmeat (Sack).
* Come up with a better strategy than the "incoming text" event to update when a KI is used.
  * This causes severe jumpiness/lag when zoning into a city and the Ballista text pops up.
